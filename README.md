The Calendar of Calendars

This is my first website. I'm starting coding this on June 2, 2022. I got the idea/inspiration from "Average Rob" a Belgian youtuber
who does some wild sports and events. It got me wondering "how tf does he hear about these things?" and then the idea came to me.
there has to be a calendar somewhere right? so why not merge them all into one spot? Then I can go see these weird things for myself.
